Dot files
========

My various config files - without secure data, of course :)

This is not (yet) a verbatim copy of my home dir - I might make it that way later...

Secure/Extra files
==================

I need to remember to copy these from backup/working system

* .gitconfig.email - Personal data for git
* .gist-vim - Auth token for the Gist Vim plugin

To-do
=====

* Zshrc
* More XMonad stuff

Stand-alone puppet config module for this + vim? Might be worthwile...
